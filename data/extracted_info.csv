Consequences of Erudite Vernacular Utilized Irrespectiveof Necessity: Problems with Using Long Words Needlessly,2005,DANIEL M. OPPENHEIMER,"Most texts on writing style encourage authors to avoid overly-complex words. However, a majorityof undergraduates admit to deliberately increasing the complexity of their vocabulary so as to givethe impression of intelligence. This paper explores the extent to which this strategy is effective.Experiments 1–3 manipulate complexity of texts and ﬁnd a negative relationship between complex-ity and judged intelligence. This relationship held regardless of the quality of the original essay, andirrespective of the participants’ prior expectations of essay quality. The negative impact ofcomplexity was mediated by processing ﬂuency. Experiment 4 directly manipulated ﬂuency andfound that texts in hard to read fonts are judged to come from less intelligent authors. Experiment 5investigated discounting of ﬂuency. When obvious causes for low ﬂuency exist that are not relevantto the judgement at hand, people reduce their reliance on ﬂuency as a cue; in fact, in an effort not tobe inﬂuenced by the irrelevant source of ﬂuency, they over-compensate and are biased in the oppositedirection. Implications and applications are discussed. Copyright#2005 John Wiley &"
